Page #  | Reviewer # | Comments
------------ | -------- | --------
0 | 1 | Added paper goal to the abstract.
1 | 3 | Expanded caption for Figure 1.
2 | 1, 2, 3 | Removed repeated paragraph staring with "Each metric..."
2 | 3 | Added citation for linked plots
4 | 3 | Capitalization issue with "CommuniD3".
5 | 3 | Refer to the color "shading" of dots on the map.
11 | 3 | Removed references to "Binned density plot", changed to "2D binned plot."
NA | 3 | Hovering on the map points displays the name of the community in a tooltip. We recommend using a modern browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) to ensure that these tooltips appear. Though we agree adding more tooltips to the application would be a useful addition, it would involve a fairly extensive reworking of the application.
2 | 3 | We agree that to perform statistical tests, the use of the survey weights is imperative. We have addressed this point in the introduction.
1 | 3 | We have added a brief discussion on the selection of the regions.
8 | 3 | Section 3.1 was intentionally designed to guide the reader through the use of CommuniD3 by telling a story. We left some of the conclusions to the reader by displaying the graphics from CommuniD3.
13 | 3 | We added an alpha to the gray lines to draw further attention to Myrtle Beach and the other Southeast communities.
14 | 3 | The density plot on the next page represents the same data as the table. We felt that the table could give more specific information for those who wanted it.
